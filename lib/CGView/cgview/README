----------------------------------------------------------- 
To test CGView, switch to the cgview directory. Try the following
command, which generates a PNG image of the map described in the
cybercell.xml file:

>java -jar cgview.jar -i cybercell.xml -o cybercell.png -f png
----------------------------------------------------------- 
Running CGView:

usage: java -jar cgview.jar [options]

Where the options are:

-A <integer> Specifies the label font size to use. This value
overrides CGView's default label font size and label font size values
specified in XML input.

-c <integer> Specifies the base to center on when
zooming. Optional. Default value is 1.

-D <integer> Specifies the legend font size to use. This value
overrides CGView's default legend font size and legend font size
values specified in XML input.

-d <real> A value between 0 and 1 that controls the density of tick
marks. Use 0 for no tick marks or 1 for the default level of tick
marks. Optional. Default value is 1.

-E <boolean> Whether or not to include text as vector-based objects in
SVG output. Optional. Default value is true.

-e <boolean> Whether or not to exclude SVG output when generating a
series of linked images using the -s option. Optional. Default value
is false.

-f <format> The format of the output: PNG, JPG, SVG, or
SVGZ. Optional. Default value is PNG.

-h <file>. HTML file to create. Optional. Default value is null.

-H <integer>. The height of the map. This value overrides any value
specified in the input file. Optional. Default value is set in the
input file or by CGView.

-i <file> The input file to parse. Required.

-I <boolean> Whether or not to draw labels on the inside of the
 backbone circle. Optional. Default is to draw labels on the inside
 when a zoomed map is drawn.

-L <integer> Specifies the width of a separate legend to use as the
legend in HTML output. Optional. Default value is null. If generating
a linked map series, place a file called legend.png in the includes
directory that is created. If generating a single HTML file, place a
file called legend.png into the same directory as the HTML file. When
the map is rendered, the legend.png image is placed to the right of
the map.

-o <file> The image file to create. Required, unless -s used to
specify that an image series is to be written to a directory. An image
series is made up of PNG and SVG images.

-p <path> The path to the image file in the HTML file created using
the -h option. Optional. Default is the the value specified using the
-o option.

-r <boolean> Specifies whether or not legends should be
hidden. Default value is F.

-R <boolean> Specifies whether or not labels should be hidden. Default
value is F.

-s <directory> Empty directory to receive an image series. If this
option is used, a series of zoomed views of the map is generated, and
values for -c, -f, -h, -o, -p, -u, and -z are
ignored. Optional. Default value is null.

-S <boolean> Whether or not to reference external stylesheet in HTML
output. Optional. Default value is false. Set to true automatically
when -s option is used.

-u <boolean> Whether or not to include calls to the overlib.js
JavaScript library in HTML image maps for PNG and JPG
images. Optional. Default value is true.

-D <integer>  Specifies the ruler font size to use. This value
overrides CGView's default ruler font size and ruler font size
values specified in XML input.

-W <integer>. The width of the map. This value overrides any value
specified in the input file. Optional. Default value is set in the
input file or by CGView.

-x <zoom values>. Specifies the zoom values to be used when generating
a series of linked maps using the -s option. The values are supplied
as a comma separated list containing no spaces. The first value must
be 1. Optional. Default value is 1,6,36.

-z <floating point number> The factor to zoom in by. Optional. Default
value is 1.0.

Examples: 

1. The command below will read an XML file called "cybercell.xml", and
will generate a PNG image file called "my_picture.png". An HTML file
called "view_image.html" will also be created. This HTML file will
contain the "my_picture.png" image:

java -jar cgview.jar -f png -i cybercell.xml -o my_picture.png -h
view_image.html

2. The command below will read an XML file called "cybercell.xml", and
will generate a collection of linked images and HTML pages in the
directory called "directory_for_series". The complete series can be
explored by loading the file "index.html", which will be in the
"directory_for_series" directory. Note that generating an image series
can take more than an hour.

java -jar cgview.jar -i cybercell.xml -s directory_for_series -x true

Note: If you obtain an "Out of Memory" error when drawing a very large
map, try increasing Java's heap size using the -Xmx option. For
example, use the command: 

java -jar -Xmx500m cgview.jar -i cybercell.xml -o cybercell.png -f png
